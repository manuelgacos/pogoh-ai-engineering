# POGOH AI Engineering Portfolio

An 8-week AI engineering study plan using Pittsburgh's POGOH bike sharing data to build production-ready AI systems.

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates progression from deep learning fundamentals to production AI deployment, using real Pittsburgh transportation data.

## Week-by-Week Progress
- **Week 0**: Environment Setup & Foundations (Complete)
- **Week 1**: Deep Learning Foundations (Neural Networks, Transformers)
- **Week 2**: LLMs & Text Processing (Embeddings, Basic Prompting)
- **Week 3**: Advanced Prompting & Evaluation (Optimization, Metrics)
- **Week 4**: Vector Databases & Retrieval (Search Systems)
- **Week 5**: RAG Systems & Memory (Q&A Systems)
- **Week 6**: Production APIs & Deployment (FastAPI, Docker)
- **Week 7**: MLOps & Monitoring (CI/CD, Automation)
- **Week 8**: AI Safety & Career Prep (Ethics, Portfolio)

## Technical Stack
